Hey, I'm Janaki Ram â€” a Software Developer at Oracle, where I work with the Transaction Manager for Microservices ([MicroTx](https://www.oracle.com/database/transaction-manager-for-microservices/)) team. I'm passionate about AI, distributed systems, system design. I studied Computer Science at IIT Bombay, and I'm always up for good conversations around tech (or anything else, really). 

If you'd like to chat, feel free to reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janaki-ram-puli/) or at [janakirampuli[at]gmail.com](mailto:janakirampuli@gmail.com)
