## Selected Projects

**Evasion Attacks Against Machine Learning**
*B.Tech R&D Project | Guide: Prof. Virendra Singh, IIT Bombay (2023-2024)*

- Developed a gradient-based attack framework to systematically generate adversarial examples that can bypass popular classifiers, including linear models and support vector machines (SVMs).
- Extended attacks to error-generic (any misclassification) and error-specific (targeted) scenarios, validated on MNIST digits.
- Demonstrated vulnerability via imperceptible pixel changes causing misclassification, proposed defenses like adversarial training.

**Multi-Language Question Answering System**
*Course Project | NLP | Guide: Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharya*

- Built a multi-lingual question-answering system and fine-tuned BERT on SQuAD (100k+ QA pairs).
- Achieved 80% exact match and 88% F1 score, enabling precise answer extraction from contexts.

**Compiler for C-like Language**
*Course Project | Programming Languages | Guide: Prof. Amithaba Sanyal*

- Designed compiler with flex/bison for syntax parsing, type checking, and code generation.
- Optimized register allocation and control-flow code, reducing output size while maintaining efficiency.

**Feature Addition to xv6 OS**
*Course Project | Operating Systems | Guide: Purushottam Kulkarni*

- Added system calls for process stats/memory monitoring and mmap with lazy allocation via page faults.
- Implemented multithreading using clone/join syscalls and tested FCFS scheduling for CPU optimization.
